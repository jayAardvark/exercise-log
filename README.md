This is a simple project that I made to keep track of when I jog and for how long. 

front-end: React, CSS Grid (to mimic a layout that I think better suits mobile devices instead of the standard navbar with hamburger menu layout), Bootstrap

back-end: Node, Express, Mongoose

authentication: json web token strategy
